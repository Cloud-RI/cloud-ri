## From Webpack to Web APIs - An Evolution of Web Standards

* Presenter:  Owen Buckley - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-buckley-91393447/)
* Date:   Nov. 14, 2023

Webpack was magical, you could import everything, but standards have emerged and embracing them simplifies your stack, enables you to do more and spend less time learning bespoke framework methodologies.

Owen presented a few of the Web Standards and how we can evolved webpack imports to standard APIs across the full-stack - in the browser and on the server.
